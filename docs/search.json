    "text": "Key Technical Decisions\nWhy DuckDB? Fast columnar analytics without any server setup. Works perfectly with R via the DBI interface, and handles CSV imports gracefully with readr::read_csv.\nWhy ellmer? The cleanest R-native interface to Claude’s API. Supports streaming, tool use, and multi-turn conversations — important for future iterations.\nWhy shinychat? Provides a ready-made chat UI component that integrates seamlessly with Shiny’s reactive model, allowing the AI conversation to drive dashboard state."
