```{=html}
<div style="display: flex; gap: 0.5rem; flex-wrap: wrap; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <span class="card-tag">R Shiny</span>
  <span class="card-tag">Claude AI</span>

</div>
```

## The Problem

Business intelligence tools typically require either expensive licences, specialist SQL knowledge,
or slow report-request cycles. The question: *what if anyone could ask a plain English question
and get an instant, visualised, AI-narrated answer?*

## The Solution

Synthesio is a proof-of-concept AI analytics dashboard built entirely in R. It combines:

- **ellmer** — to interface with Claude's API for both SQL generation and insight narration
- **DuckDB** — as a fast, embedded analytical database (no server required)
- **R Shiny + shinychat** — for the interactive dashboard and conversational UI
- **Plotly + reactable** — for rich visualisations and searchable data tables

## Demo

```{=html}
<div class="video-wrapper" style="margin: 2rem 0;">
  <video controls>
    <source src="../assets/demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</div>
```

## Architecture

The core pipeline follows three steps:

1. **NL → SQL** — The user's question is sent to Claude along with a database schema description.
   Claude returns a valid DuckDB SQL query.
2. **SQL → Results** — The query executes against the Northwind database in DuckDB,
   returning a dataframe.
3. **Results → Insight** — The dataframe is summarised and sent back to Claude,
   which returns a business narrative in markdown.

```{=html}
<div style="background: #1e2433; border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.08); border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-family: 'JetBrains Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.82rem; color: #8892a4;">
  User question<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;↓ <span style="color:#4a90d9;">generate_sql()</span> via ellmer + Claude<br>
  SQL query<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;↓ <span style="color:#4a90d9;">dbGetQuery()</span> via DuckDB<br>
  Dataframe<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;↓ <span style="color:#4a90d9;">generate_insight()</span> via ellmer + Claude<br>
  Markdown narrative + Plotly chart + reactable table
</div>
```

## Key Technical Decisions

**Why DuckDB?** Fast columnar analytics without any server setup. Works perfectly with R
via the DBI interface, and handles CSV imports gracefully with `readr::read_csv`.

**Why ellmer?** The cleanest R-native interface to Claude's API. Supports streaming,
tool use, and multi-turn conversations — important for future iterations.

**Why shinychat?** Provides a ready-made chat UI component that integrates seamlessly
with Shiny's reactive model, allowing the AI conversation to drive dashboard state.

## What's Next

- Connecting to live databases (PostgreSQL, Snowflake)
- Multi-turn conversational memory for follow-up questions
- User authentication and saved query history
- Deployment to a cloud environment with secure API key management
